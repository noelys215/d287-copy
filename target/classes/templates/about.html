        craftsmanship. Founded in 2024, our workshop is dedicated to creating exceptional custom guitars that cater to
        both the aesthetic and musical nuances desired by our clients. At Melody Maker Atelier, we believe that a guitar
        should resonate not only with sound but also with the soul of the musician.
